## Reflection

This was an assignment-and-a-half. I think it's not dramatic to say that this assignment really required nearly everything we've learned in this course so far. I'm actually quite impressed that I finished, although I know the functionality and design are super basic.

If I had more time, I think I could get res.render to work so that the page wouldn't reload everytime I ran the fetch requests. But I've played around with it and haven't figured it out.
